# Classifying wine data 

## Description

Can a winemaker predict the quality of wine based on the chemical properties of the wine? Are there chemical indicators that correlate more strongly with the perceived "quality" of a wine? We look at the dataset from UCI to find the answer. The dataset records 11 chemical properties of thousands of red wines from northern Portugal, as well as the quality of the wines, recorded on a scale from 1 to 10. Similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets.
