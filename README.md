# Classify code snippets into programming languages

## Description

Created a classifier that can take snippets of code and guess the programming language of the code.

## Instructions

Run prediction.py and a file as a command line argument to get a prediction of what kind of file it is

ex: predictor.py other_code.txt

The test folder contains files with different programming languages

ex: predictor.py test/1

## Other

This project contains an Ipython notebook that goes into detail about the classifier and the classifer.py file.
